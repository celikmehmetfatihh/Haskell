# HaskellProject
# Learning Outcomes:
 Have practiced how to program using functional programming languages;
 Have used different approaches to define data types in Haskell;
 Have practiced how to use recursive definitions in functional programming paradigm

In this project, we are going to work with tree structures. The case study we are going to consider
is a "Family Tree".
